Alice

That’s a funny game, uncle. What did you do then?


Carroll

A red pawn took a white pawn; this way. You see, Alice, the chessboard is divided into sixty-four squares, red and white, and the white army tries to win and the red army tries to win. It’s like a battle!


Alice

With soldiers?


Carroll

Yes, here are the Kings and Queens they are fighting for. That’s the Red Queen and here’s the White Queen."""
